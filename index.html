            <h2 class="section-title">What is Data Science?</h2>
            <p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It is a powerful tool that enables businesses to make data-driven decisions and solve complex problems.</p><br>
            <h2>Data Science LifeCycle</h2>
            
            <p>The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:</p>
            <div class="box">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Business Understanding:</b> This step focuses on defining the business problem and aligning the data science goals with the organization's objectives. Collaborating with stakeholders ensures clarity and sets the foundation for meaningful analysis. For example, identifying customers likely to churn could be a business goal.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Mining:</b> Data mining involves collecting raw data from multiple sources such as databases, APIs, or web scraping. Ensuring ethical data collection and comprehensive coverage of relevant variables is crucial. For instance, gathering customer demographics and purchase history helps in understanding behaviors.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Cleaning:</b> Raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates, which need to be resolved during cleaning. This step ensures the dataset is accurate and usable. For example, missing values can be imputed, and duplicate entries removed to improve quality.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Exploration:</b> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Visualization techniques like scatter plots and histograms help uncover insights. For example, correlations between variables can reveal potential predictors for modeling.</li>
                                <li><b>Feature Engineering:</b> Feature engineering involves creating new variables or transforming existing ones to enhance the dataset. This improves model performance. For instance, combining data into a "customer loyalty score" provides a more meaningful representation of behavior.</li>
                                <li><b>Predictive Modeling:</b> This step applies machine learning or statistical models to predict outcomes or classify data. Models are trained and tested to ensure accuracy. For example, logistic regression can predict customer churn, while clustering identifies user segments.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Visualization:</b> The final step involves presenting insights through charts, dashboards, or reports. This helps stakeholders make informed decisions. For example, a dashboard showing churn factors can guide targeted interventions effectively.</li>

                            <p>A data scientist collects, analyzes, and interprets big data to uncover patterns and insights, make predictions, and create actionable plans. Big data can be defined as datasets that have greater variety, volume, and velocity than earlier methods of data management were equipped to handle. Data scientists work with many types of big data, including:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Structured data:</b> which is typically organized in rows and columns and includes words and numbers such as names, dates, and credit card information. For example, a data scientist in the utility industry might analyze tables of power generation and usage data to help reduce costs and detect patterns that could cause equipment to fail</li>
                                <li><b>Unstructured data:</b> which is unorganized and includes text in document files, social media and mobile data, website content, and videos. For example, a data scientist in the retail industry might answer a question about improving the customer experience by analyzing unstructured call center notes, emails, surveys, and social media posts.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>Additionally, the characteristics of the dataset can be described as <b>quantitative</b>, structured numerical data, or <b>qualitative</b> or categorical data, which is not represented through numerical values and can be grouped based on categories. It's important for data scientists to know the type of data they're working with, as it directly impacts the type of analyses they perform and the types of graphs they can use to visualize the data</p>
